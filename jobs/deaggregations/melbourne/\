#  Default initial .bashrc for the ac.  
#
#  Much of your environment should be setup in your .profile or
#  .bash_profile file.  The environment configured there will be
#  inherited by subshells, scripts, batch job etc.  This file 
#  (.bashrc) should only be used to define aliases, functions and, 
#  where necessary, terminal settings.  By default this file will 
#  be sourced for every bash shell and script so avoid unnecessary 
#  actions.  
#
#  See your .profile file for examples of how to add paths to 
#  software in your environment.
#  See http://nf.nci.org.au/facilities/software/modules.php
#  for instructions on how to set your environment to use specific
#  software packages.
