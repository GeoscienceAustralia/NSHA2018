NSHA18 Licence
========================

The code accessible through the NSHA18 Geoscience Australia github repository was developed to host working files during the development of the NSHA18. Detail on the development of the NSHA18 and the supporting product suite, is freely available for download [here](http://www.ga.gov.au/about/projects/safety/nsha).
 
**This repository is not intentioned as the authoritative model files for the NSHA18 product.**

The model files that underpinned the final version of the NSHA are available in [Geoscience Australia Record 2018/32](http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/123049). The NSHA18 model files contain third party models (referenced in [GA Record 2018/32](http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/123049)) and authors of these models have agreed and acknowledged that their models form part of the NSHA18 product and therefore subject to the copyright and licencing conditions of the NSHA18 product suite. 
The copyright and licencing conditions of the NSHA18 product suite are detailed below.
