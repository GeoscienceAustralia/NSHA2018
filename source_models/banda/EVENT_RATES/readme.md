This folder contains .csv files with earthquake rate models taken from the 2018 update to the Australian Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment. Rate models are developed in a Bayesian framework from fault slip-rates and earthquake occurrence rates. The method for generating the rate models is described in:

Davies, G., Griffin, J., LÃ¸vholt, F., Glimsdal, S., Harbitz, C., Thio, H.K., Lorito, S., Basili, R., Selva, J., Geist, E. and Baptista, M.A., 2018. A global probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment from earthquake sources. Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 456(1), pp.219-244.

Rate models described in these .csv files are probabilities of exceedance, i.e. the rate associated to magnitude m is:
prob(Mw >= m)
