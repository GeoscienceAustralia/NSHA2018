Tips for generating seismic source models
=========================================

1) First generate base source model shapefiles that will provide the foundation for calculation of magnitude-frequency statistics:
	- for each area-source model, run shapefiles/<source model>/make_<source model>_model.py (e.g. make_Domains_model.py)
	- these scripts will generate shapefiles that will be subsequently read to generate MFD files
	
2)
