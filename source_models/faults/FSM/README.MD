Simplified Fault Source Model Attributes as derived from the [Australian Neotectonic Feature Database](http://www.ga.gov.au/earthquakes/staticPageController.do?page=neotectonics):

*	Name: 	 	fault name
* Length:	 	length of simplified fault in km
* Dip:		 	fault dip (often assumed from analogue features)
* dip_dir:	direction of fault dip
* SL_RT_ST:	short-term slip rate in m/Million years (zero if unknown)
* SL_RT_LT:	long-term slip rate in m/Million years
* UP_RT_ST:	short-term uplift rate in m/Million years (zero if unknown)
* UP_RT_LT:	long-term uplift rate in m/Million years
* Comment:	comments field
* Displacement:	total displacement estimate in metres<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Total displacement estimate for neotectonic features from the Australian Neotectonic Features database (updated from [Clark et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195112004076?via%3Dihub); [Clark et al., 2014](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/intraplate-earthquakes/intraplate-earthquakes-in-australia/83F5E87128E0D64F5A3A08D254E9D6E8)). For instances where robust displacement information is not available, estimates have been made using offset landscape features imaged in SRTM 90 m and ALOS 30 m resolution DEMs. Reverse ruptures are assumed to be exclusively dip slip (which may underestimate displacement in the Otway and Gippsland basins), and features on the northwest shelf are assumed to be exclusively strike-slip.
